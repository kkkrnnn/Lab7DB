I don't want to see a show about a horse constantly suffering at the fate of humanity. It's just mean and makes you have an existential crisis. This show is just so mean and cruel and says that the world is bad and no matter how much you improve yourself, your past mistakes will catch up to you. It also has an unappealing and ugly art style that just makes me wanna look away at it rather than watch it. Don't watch this show if you want to be happy. Don't watch Adam Ruins Everything either. Watch Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry, Tiny Toons, Garfield, Terrytoons or something. This show also is just furrybait.
