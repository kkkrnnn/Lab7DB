The animation and overall quality of the drawings are terrible and ugly the story is a ripoff nicolas cage's character from leaving las vegas James Mason in a Star Is Born Even Starling Archer from Archer the only difference is he's a grotesque horse head with a humanoid body. Usually something like that would be hunted down with pitchforks and torches not a failed te. evision actor. He is unrelatable and uninteresting when his mother died I couldn't believe some people thought that was a sad moment. This show cannot get me to sympathize with these poorly drawn poorly written characters like most "animated adult comedies" it is ironically childish and uncomedic from everything that seth macfarlane has made to the terrible american animated comedies on the ironically named comedy central tbs and on netflix. Most animated adult comedies are poor simpsons imitations with poor animation quality that are made for the lowest common denominator Bojack Horseman is no exception.
