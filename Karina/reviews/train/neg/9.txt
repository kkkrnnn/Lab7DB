People worship this show and act like it's the Iliad or some genius profound insight into society, when really it's some bland show that's alright I guess. People say that mid-season 1 is when the show achieves it's never before seen greatness, but for me that's when it just got more and more boring. (Not to mention the political bias) The characters are unlikable, and while they are well-written, it doesn't really matter if you are apathetic about whatever happens to them. Another thing is the stylistic choices. I get that this is subjective, but why are all of the characters so unappealing to look at? Overall, Bojack Horseman is nothing to get excited about.
