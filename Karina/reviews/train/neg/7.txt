Hollywood protects its own demographic, at the expense of outsiders, successful in it, especially, of another demographic, while breaking all natural rules. That is the true message of this mess. The term "cartoon", used to imply *innocent*. Not anymore. There are no names mentioned, when makers of the presentation get asked. They never admit it's about any one person. It's the one secret they stubbornly keep, despite the story hard suggesting. Moreover, it gives away the reality that if a hollywood production isn't liked, in Hollywood, it's treated like a non success, by the insiders, regardless, even if the audience has seen it and liked it.
