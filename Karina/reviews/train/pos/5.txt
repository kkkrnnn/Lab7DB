Who would have thought a cartoon about anthropomorphic animals would find the best way of depicting human errors, human psychology, depression and anxiety?

When the first season hit, no one was impressed. Human like animals in Los Angels about celebrity depression and narcissism? No one was buying into it, myself included.

That was until The Telescope episode happened. It mixed heavy themes such as cancer, betrayal, forgiveness and deep resentment. That was essentially the moment where it became more than a funny/sad satire on Hollywood culture.

Bojack represents the most real, most complex and enriching portrayal of a character neglected and abused as a child, learned how to be good from television (which is not always the best teacher) became empowered through drugs and alcohol and entered Hollywood by starring in a popular 90s sitcom.

The series examines what it means to be good person, the question of whether or not you can change your ways and how terrible behavior will eventually catch up to you. While shows featuring male anti-heroes such as The Sopranos, Breaking Bad and Mad Men, this one very much centers its women as empowered from the get go and are multifaceted. Despite sometimes being victims of the main character's sometimes awful deeds, their traumas are not forgotten about like they are in other shows, so that the flawed male character can move on with his life. In fact, the show makes it very clear that every terrible act caused by Bojack has lasting effects on those he hurts that will come back to bite him, celebrity or not.

You can feel sympathy for Bojack while not condoning his actions - due to the flashbacks detailing his childhood before fame. The show also doesn't pull any punches when it comes to depicting truly heavy themes, as well as not offering any simple solutions by the end.

Truly unique and riveting.
