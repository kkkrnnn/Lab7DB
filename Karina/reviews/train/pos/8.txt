BoJack Horseman is a series that came strongly recommended by my fianc√©e and is available on Netflix. The storyline focuses on a self indulged former sitcom star that has made some friends, some famous and some not so much, and follows his life as he makes bad investment, life, and friendship related decisions. This series was created by Raphael Bob-Waksberg (Undone) and includes voices from Will Arnett (Arrested Development), Amy Sedaris (Elf), Alison Brie (Glow), Paul F. Tompkins (There will be Blood) and Keith Olbermann (ESPN). The animation for this is fun in a Family Guy kind of way. The personalities and uniqueness of the characters is so good. Also, the concept of animals and humans living together was portrayed well. I really liked how they did it and the comedic content was a nice blend of dry and consistent awkwardness. Overall, this is a fun series for adults that I would score a solid 9/10.
