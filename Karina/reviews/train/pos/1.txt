The story of a horse that changed my life. Yes Bojack Horseman is simply something more than an animation series about animals and humans living together, not that it is much bigger than that. At first, I strongly objected to the evaluation of the first episode of Bojack, which scored 7.1, man. What is that? I watched it four times and laughed the same amount each time. Anyway, let's start the review. The first season was hugely funny and intelligent, but nothing was measured by the rest of the seasons. The series starts from the second season and reaches its climax in the third and continues to evolve until the last episode that will leave you feeling a great emptiness around you after you finish this great show Bojack is one of my top 10 so I won't talk more than that. One of the few offers that deserves a high rating. My rating 9.8
